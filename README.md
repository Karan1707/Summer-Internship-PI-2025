## 📅 Weekly Breakdown  

### ✅ Week 1 – Python & Cybersecurity Fundamentals  
- Basics of Python programming (variables, loops, functions, file handling)  
- Introduction to cybersecurity concepts: CIA Triad, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Attacks  
- Ethical hacking workflow & lab setup (Kali Linux / Virtual Machines / Python IDEs)  
- **Hands-on:** Writing simple Python scripts for encryption, file handling, and automation  

---

### ✅ Week 2 – Cryptography & Security Utilities  
- Introduction to **Classical Cryptography**  
  - Caesar Cipher & Substitution methods  
- Basics of **password security** (hashing, strength evaluation, brute-force concepts)  
- **Practice Projects:**  
  - 🛡️ Caesar Cipher (encryption & decryption tool in Python)  
  - 🔑 Password Strength Checker (rule-based + regex validation)  

---

### ✅ Week 3 – System Security & Networking Tools  
- Understanding **keylogging techniques** (ethical perspective & safe demonstrations)  
- Basics of **networking & packet analysis**  
- Concepts: OSI model, TCP/IP basics, sniffing, spoofing, packet headers  
- **Practice Projects:**  
  - ⌨️ Keylogger (logs keystrokes to a file, educational use only)  
  - 🌐 Packet Sniffer (captures and displays packet information like source/destination IP, protocol, payload)

### ✅ Week 4 – Mini Project: Brute Force Attack Simulator & Defender  
In the final week, I worked on a **mini project** titled **"Brute Force Attack Simulator & Defender"**.  

- **Objective:**  
  To simulate brute force password attacks on a system and implement defense mechanisms against them.  

- **Features:**  
  - Simulates brute force attacks on password-protected accounts.  
  - Implements account lockout policy after multiple failed attempts.  
  - Tracks and logs attack attempts for analysis.  
  - Demonstrates importance of strong passwords and defensive measures.  

- **Concepts Applied:**  
  - Password security & brute force attack techniques  
  - Rate limiting & lockout mechanisms  
  - Logging & monitoring failed login attempts  
  - Python automation for offensive and defensive security  

- **Outcome:**  
  This project highlights how brute force attacks work in practice and how simple defensive strategies can mitigate them.
